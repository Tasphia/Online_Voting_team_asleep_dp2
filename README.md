# Smart Online Voting & Election Management System
##Problem Statement
A country faces huge challenges in conducting fair and efficient elections. Traditional voting system
like EVM faces corruption such as voter fraud, fake votes, vote-buying, booth capturing, low voter
participations due to political pressure in rural regions. These are serious concerns in the current
voting system. Additionally, millions of its citizens live abroad for study or job purposes and also
many students and job holders who live in another city or regions are unable to participate in
elections due to the lack of an efficient online voting system. This project aims to develop and design
a secure, transparent, and scalable online voting system for this countryâ€™s electoral needs with
integrating multi-layer security and real time voter tracking to ensure credibility and fairness.
