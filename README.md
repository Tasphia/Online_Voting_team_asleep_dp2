# Smart Online Voting & Election Management System

## Problem Statement
A country faces huge challenges in conducting fair and efficient elections. Traditional voting systems like EVM face corruption such as voter fraud, fake votes, vote-buying, booth capturing, and low voter participation due to political pressure in rural regions. Additionally, millions of citizens living abroad or in different cities are unable to participate in elections due to the lack of an efficient online voting system.

This project aims to develop and design a secure, transparent, and scalable online voting system with multi-layer security and real-time voter tracking to ensure credibility and fairness.

## Objectives
1. Develop a secure and accessible online voting system to increase voter participation.
2. Implement multi-layer authentication to prevent fraudulent voting.
3. Ensure real-time vote tallying and transparency in election results.
4. Provide a role-based access system for election officials, auditors, and voters.
5. Adapt the system to electoral regulations and socio-cultural considerations.

## Proposed Solution
A web-based voting system will be developed for election management, voter authentication, data integrity assurance, and real-time result calculation.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Node.js
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Security Protocols:** End-to-end encryption, OTP-based authentication, Face recognition
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based hosting for scalability

## Key Features
1. **Voter Registration & Authentication**
   - Verification through NID, face recognition, and OTP authentication.
2. **Secure Vote Casting**
   - Encrypted vote storage for data security.
3. **Real-Time Vote Counting**
   - Automatic updates after each vote and final results after election closure.
4. **Audit Logs & Transparency**
   - All actions are recorded for independent audits.

## Innovative Features
1. Tailored for the election process, incorporating national regulations.
2. Prevents double voting through NID-linked verification.
3. Multi-factor authentication with facial recognition.
4. Remote voting support for overseas and remote citizens.
5. Allows voters to confirm their vote via SMS or email.
6. Audit-ready system ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Methodology
### Software Development Approach
- Agile methodology with iterative testing and feedback loops.

### System Architecture
1. **Frontend (JavaScript)**
   - User interface for registration, voting, and result viewing.
2. **Backend (Python, Node.js)**
   - Handles authentication, vote processing, and data encryption.
3. **Database (MySQL)**
   - Stores voter information, votes, and audit logs.
4. **Security Implementation**
   - Face recognition, OTP-based authentication, encrypted vote storage.

## Expected Outcomes
- A functional, secure online voting system.
- Increased voter turnout due to remote accessibility.
- Reduced election costs by minimizing physical polling expenses.
- Real-time result availability, improving efficiency and fairness.

## Tools & Resources Needed
- **Development Tools:** VS Code, Postman (API Testing), GitHub
- **Cloud Services:** AWS or DigitalOcean for hosting
- **Database Management:** MySQL for database design
